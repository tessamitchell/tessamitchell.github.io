        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Tessa Mitchell.  I am in my third year at the University of Missouri (graduating May 2027), where I am studying computer science.
            I am also minoring in both Math and Digital Storytelling on the Film Production track.
            I grew up in the Northland of Kansas City, Missouri.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up, I regularly changed what I wanted to do.  In kindergarten, I wanted to be an art teacher, and had a whole plan about how when my school's art teacher 
            (who was no where near retirement age) retired, I was going to take her job.  By second/third grade, I wanted to be a librarian, at least until I learned that they 
            didn't just get to read books all day.  After that, I switched to wanting to be an author.  In sixth grade I took my first non-typing computer class, where one of our 
            projects was making either a movie trailer or a commercial.  I made a trailer for a thriller about an alien invasion and fell in love with video editing along the way.
            After that, I took every computer class that was offered.  In 7th grade, that meant another general purpose class where our projects included learning Microsoft Word and Excel, Photoshop,
            making a lyric video for a song in Adobe Premiere Pro, and learning some basic html.  That year, I also took part in my school's "professional studies" program during the 40-minute enrichment time-block.
            I was in the Video Editing class, where we made an introduction video for the incoming middle-schoolers.  The teacher tasked me specifically with making the final edit of the video, 
            due to my passion and skill.  I used interviews filmed by other students in the class, created my own voice over, and re-shot the "tour" timelapse.  I would have loved to continue on this video editing path, 
            however, after that, there were no more classes available, and so the best I could do was taking advantage of having to record myself for other class projects and experimenting there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting in eighth grade, the computer classes offered at my school were all coding based.  I had done a bit of this using code.org in 5th grade, but there were only so many snowflakes I could draw or ways I
            could modify Flappy Bird before I got bored.  However, I liked the teacher and enjoyed learning about computer capabilities, so I took the 8th grade computer class and learned block-based coding using 
            MIT App Inventor and Micro:bit.  This time, it worked.  I loved how coding was like solving puzzles, how there was so many ways to achieve the same thing, and it was just a matter of finding the right one.  It
            was the same reason I loved math, especially once I got into algebra and advanced math courses.  After that, I ended up taking all the computer science courses my high school had to offer, going from block-based 
            coding, to Python, to Java.  
        </p>
        <p>
            By that point, it pretty much felt like a given that I'd major in computer science when I went to college.  Coding allows me to flex my analytic and problem solving skills, while still getting my creative juices flowing and allowing myself to test
            the limits of what I'm able to do.  I love how simple lines of codes, when combined in just the right way can create something new.
            Because of my love of art, my original end goal for computer science was video game design or virtual reality, because I loved the opportunities to be creative and meld math and art.
            However, at this point in time, I don't have a specific field of computer science I am most passionate about.  At the moment, I'm simply trying to gain new skills and challenge my abilities.

            When it comes to the Digital Storytelling minor, I had a lot of credits transferred from high school through taking AP and dual credit classes,
            and I knew I wanted to take some more artistic courses to strengthen my creative skills.  Through my interest in video game design, I wanted to look into animation, so I started looking into the Digital Storytelling minor.
            Digital Storytelling at Mizzou has three main paths, film, animation, and video art, but they all have to take the same intro class, so I took that my freshman year.  That class was an introduction to the ideas of composition and lighting,
            and primarily focused on film and video production.  This reignited my love of video editing and rather than take the animation classed for my minor, I decided I'd rather focus on the film production side of things.
