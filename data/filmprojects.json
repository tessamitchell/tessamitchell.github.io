        "description":"I chose to make my documentary about my hometown.  Specifically, its involvement in the Underground Railroad.  However, through my interviews I managed to get a lot of footage and information on this and similar topics, enough to potentially make a much longer documentary later on.",

        "description":"My film wasn't chosen to be produced which meant I was not the director.  Instead I filled a variety of roles like Producer, Assistant Director, Camerawoman, etc.  The film wasn't my personal vision, and I would have approached the storytelling differently, however my job was to fulfill that of the director.  I also fell sick during the bulk of the filming days, and was only there for two of the final scenes.  As part of the group, however, we all got to make our own final edit, which is where I was able to really shine.  I created all the graphics myself in Photoshop and then used After Effects to incorporate them into the final edit.",
