I fulfilled a variety of roles: Assistant Director, Art Director, Camera, Executive Producer, etc.  The film wasn't my personal vision, and I would have approached the storytelling differently, however my job was to fulfill that of the director.  I also fell sick during the bulk of the filming days, and was only there for two of the final scenes.  As part of the group, however, we all got to make our own final edit, which is where I was able to really shine.  I created all the graphics myself in Photoshop and then used After Effects to incorporate them into the final edit.",
